You will be given one text and one sentence. Decide whether the sentence can be entailed from the text. 

Provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON response following this format, without deviation:
{
  "consistency": 0,
  "reason": "reason for answering 0 or 1",
}

For the consistency, answer with 0 or 1. Answer 1 only if the sentence can be inferred from the text. If the sentence contradicts the text or contains information not found in the text, answer 0. 
Only use information found in the text. Do not use any contextual knowledge or information from other sources. Provide a reason for answering 0 or 1.

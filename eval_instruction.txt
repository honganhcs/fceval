You will be given a text and different sentences. For each sentence, decide whether it can be entailed from the text.
Answer 1 if the information in the sentence is stated in the text. 
Answer 0 if any information in the sentence is not stated in the text, even if the information is factual.
Provide a specific reason for your answer. 

In your response, only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON following this format, without deviation:
[
  {
    "sentence_number": 1,
    "entailed": 0,
    "reason": "reason for answering 0 or 1"
  },
]

Strictly do not include any other text other than the above JSON, as it affects parsing of the result.

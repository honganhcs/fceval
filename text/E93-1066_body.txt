This poster paper describes a full scale two-level morphological description ( Karttunen , 1983 , Koskenniemi , 1983 of Turkish word structures . The description has been implemented using the PC-KIMMO environment ( Antworth , 1990 ) and is based on a root word lexicon of about 23,000 roots words . Almost all the special cases of and exceptions to phonological and morphological rules have been implemented . Turkish is an agglutinative language with word structures formed by productive affixations of derivational and inflectional suffixes to root words . Turkish has finite-state but nevertheless rather complex morphotactics . Morphemes added to a root word or a stem can convert the word from a nominal to a verbal structure or vice-versa , or can create adverbial constructs . The surface realizations of morphological constructions are constrained and modified by a number of phonetic rules such as vowel harmony . The phonetic rules of contemporary Turkish have been encoded using 22 two-level rules while the morphotactics of the agglutinative word structures has been encoded as finite-state machines for verbal , nominal paradigms . Our lexicons are based on the comprehensive word list that we have compiled for our spelling checker developed earlier ( Solak and Oflazer , 1992 This poster has presented a summary of the first full scale implementation of two-level description of Turkish morphology . We have been using this description as a morphological parsing module in a number of applications like LFG parsing , ATN parsing and semantics analysis of Turkish sentences .

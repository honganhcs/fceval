Ambiguity of determiners is one of the most striking phenomena of natural language ; what is strange is the case with ~hich humans use them : it seems that the molteplicity of interpretations of a ncun phrase including a determiner is not explicitly perceived by human users of rmtural language [ Hobbs 1983 ] . The approach we chose tries to model this behavier : each determiner has a charac ~ teristic semantic interpretation , which is different from that of ot ] qer determiners and which can be furtherly specified an the basis of the information contents gathered from the overall ean ~ text and frfxn the remsining part of the sentence . If such an information contents is rot sufficient , then the meaning of the determiner remains ambiguous . What is of paramount i~rtance is that any determiner has a `` single '' meaning , that can be furtherly specified by the context . Of course , we need to express the se~sntics of determiners by means of a suitable representation . The one that we propose seems to be intuitively acceptable , formally precise and suitable for a cm~positional analysis of natural language that , even if questienable in some particular cases , is still one of the approaches that guarantee the most reasonable degree of generality in semantic interpretation . It is obvious that the representation of a sentence in such a fon~sliem may contain ambiguities ; therefore a further step is needed in order to obtain an unambigtmus deep specification of its meaning . Contrarily to the intermediate logical formalism we are going to discuss , this firml specification will rot be given in declarative form , but in terms of operations on an underlying knowledge base . Ct~ main goals in designing the representation formalism that will be used in the following sections were : I ) To maintain a close relationship between the pieces of informstion that are intuitively present in the input sentence and the predicates appearing in its interpretation . 2 ) To make explicit the distinction between surface objects and semantic entities : words on one side and concepts , individuals , classes etc . on the other . 3 ) To maintain a co~itional analysis of language , where the starting point is provided by the dependency tree built by the rule~bassd syntactic cogent of the FIDO system [ Le~no , Torasso 84 ; Les~o , Torasso 85a ; Lesmo , Toraseo 85b ] . + Partially supported by MPI Project `` Architetture Software per Sistemi Intelligenti '' Supported by a fellowship of CSI Pienmnte 344 4 ) To devise a set of predicates allowing an easy translation between the obtained representation and the corresponding operations cn a Knowledge Base . A first example concerns a very simple sentence : I ) Bob loves Lucy . The representation is ( lower case strings refer to variables ; upper case ones to constants or predicates ) : Ir ) REF ( S , x , BOB ) & REF ( S , y , LOVE ) & RFF ( S , z , LUCY ) & AG~F ( y , x ) & OBJECT ( y , z ) This can be read as : there are three internal entities ( x , y , z ) ; the speaken ( S ) is referring to the first of them by using the word BOB , to the second with TO LOVE , to the third with LUCY ; the agent of y is x , its obiect is z. Fig.1 depicts , in terms of nodes and arcs , the proposed representation . REF predicates are meant to indicate the mapping between words and internal nodes . Consider now ex.2 : 2 ) The boy loves a girl The representation reported below disregards the information con ~ tents gathered from the determiners : 2r ) REF ( S , x , BOY ) & REF ( S , y , LOVE ) & R [ F ( S , y , GIRL ) & A ( ~r ( y , x ) & OBJECT ( y , z ) The representation is analogous to the previous one . On the other hand , some problems arise in this case ; they concern the com~uni~ eative impact of ex.2 , and which were not evident in the previous exan~ ) le . If we say `` Bob loves Lucy '' , we assume that whoever hears this sentence knows both Bob and Lucy , so that he is able to reconstruct the right semantic interpretation , and to identify the specific individuals to whom the speaker is referring . But how can the hearer convey such kind of informmtion when explicit names are not available ? And , on the opposite side , how can the speaker tell the hearer that he is not referring to any specific individual , but he wants to mention a general property of the class ? We believe that the discriminating information is carried by determiners . If we take them into account , we should state that ex.2 expresses something as : `` BOY ( this word should suffice for yca to identify whom I 'm talking about ) LOVES GIRL ( this word is not specific enough to allow you to identify the correct referent ) '' or , if we think of a knowledge base represented as a semantic net ~ work : `` Dear hearer , you should find a node satisfying the 'BOY ' description ( and if ysu consider the context , this can be done unambiguously ) , then yca should create a new node of type 'GIRL ' and connect them via a nede which is an 'ACT~OF 'LOVE ' `` CONUEP~ NET ~ `` THING '' SS -i ~ ~ OBJ -- ~ , \ IS-A ~ \ IS-A \\ ACT-OF BOB LUCY TO LOVE SURFACE WORDS INSTANCE NET fig.l We 'can give now the complete representation of ex.2 : 2r ' ) RFF ( S , x , BOY ) & IDENTIFIABLE ( S , S , x ) & ENABLESAF~REF ( S , H , BOY ) & REF ( S , y , LOVE ) & REF ( S , z , GIRL ) & IDENTIFIABLE ( S , S , z ) and not ENABII~AMF~ , ' ( S , H , GIRL ) & AGF/~ ] ' ( y , x ) & OBJECT ( y , z ) that is : `` The .~ ) eaker is referring to entity x by ~eans of the ~rd BOY , he assumes that x is identifiable to himself and that the description used ( BOY ) enables the hearer to refer to the same entity ; there Ls also an act of loving ( y ) and another entity ( z ) what ] he is referring to by means of the word GIRL ; z is identifiable to himself , but the word GIRL will not enable the hearer to refer to the same entity he is thinking about . Finally , x is the agent of y and z is the object of y '' . Actually , 2r ' does not correspond exactly to sentence 2 . In fact Ex.2 is mrbiguous whilst 2r ' is not . The source of ambiguity is the NP `` a girl '' . In the previous discussions we . assumed that the speaker knows the girl loved by `` the boy '' , but this is not necessarily true . Tne `` specific '' reading is given in 2r ' by the presence of the predicate IDENTIFIABLE ( S , S , z ) . Now , how can we account for the inherent ambiguity of the indefinite determiner ? Simply droppi~ from its sei & nntics the `` IDENTIFIABLE '' prcdicate : it will be added in case the context provides m~fficient clues to infer the `` specific '' interpretation , or its negation ( `` not IDEN = TIFIABLE '' ) will be added in case some evidence about a `` generic '' interpretetion is available . No predicate is added ( and the sen ~tence remains a~bi [ ~ous , as it actually is ) if no disambign~ating criterium is provided by the context . the approach exemplified above will be de~.~ribed in the next section , covering the definite and Jndef ] nite determiners . The predicates used are listed below , together with an explanation of their intuitive meaning . x is able to refer to eatity y by by means of expression z. ENABLESAMERI.Im ( x , y , z ) : Ir~ ] ividual x assures that individual y is able to identify , by i~eans of expression z , the s~me entity which he refers to . IDENTIFIABLE ( x , y , z ) : Individual x assumes that individual y is able to identify ( or that y knows ) entity z. Sl~2 ( x ) : Entity x is a set composed of at least t~c elements . ARBITRARY ( x , z ) : Any member of the class x identified by be expression z necessarily satisfies the property expressed by the pro ~ position in which z occurs . We wi ] 1 de~.ribe ~ne representations we have adopted for determiners , fell.owing the classification introduced in [ Croft 85 ] , which we . report here ( note , however , that the ARBITRARY predicate introduced above does not correspond to 'arbitrary ' in Croft 's c ] assification , only to its 'not defeasible ' subclass ) : Pereeptual ] y available ( this , that ) Table I lists the various representations we have adopted , b ) t us consider first the definite determiners ( we are not going to discuss what Enoft refers to as 'perceptually available'-referent determiners , i.e . de~mstratives like 'this ' and 'that ' ) . Tne representation for 'the ' reported in table I can be para '' phrased as : `` there exists an entity that the speaker is able to refer to by ma~s of the expression following the determiner ; the speaker asam~s that that expression will enable the hearer to refer to the ~me entity ; the speaker is ~le to identiDI the referred entity '' . An example is provided by 3 ) I1 ragazzo mangia ( The boy is eating ) 3r ) REF ( S , x , BOY ) & ENABLESAF~REF ( S , H , BOY ) & IDENTIFIABLE ( S , S , x ) & REF ( S , y , TO EAT ) & A .C6lJT ( y , x ) It ~st be noted that it is not written anywhere that the entity x has to be m~ individual . In principle , it could be a generic entity ( i.e . an 'intensional ' node of a semantic not ) , thus fulfilling the role of 'prototype individual ' [ Grosz , Jo~qni , ~in~ stein 83 ] . A few ~rds now to discuss plurals . For example : 4 ) I ragazzi mangiano ( The boys are eating ) 4r ) REF ( S , x , BOY ) & ~NABLESAF~_ , '.REF ( SjI , BOY ) & IDENÂ£IFIABLE ( S , S , x ) & R~ ( S , y , TO RAT ) & AGENT ( y , x ) & SEIT ( X ) The enly difference is the presence of the predicate SET2 ( x ) , ~hich states that the entity x is a set . We use the r~ SEF2 to evidentiate that it refers to the pretheoretical notion of set as ' a group ' ca~posed by mere than ore element . As regards indefinite determiners , the representations given in Table I can be paraphrased as : `` There is an entity that the speaker is able to refer to by means of the expression following the determiner ; the speaker can not assume that that expression will enable the hearer to refer to the seme entity '' . Let us consider first the 'specific ' meaning of the determiner ' a ' This interpretation is the simplest one , since it directly encodes the basic m~ning of ' the indefinite determiner , i.e . the reference to an unspecified entity . A first problem is how to get the 'generic ' rreaning f~ii this representation ( epistemic and intensio~l interpretations will be analyzcwl afterw~lrds , since they do not appear as subjnots of sentences ) . In : 6 ) Un onso va in letargo in inverno ( A bear hibernates in winter ) you could probably perceive a ~r~ @ tning such as : `` If yea randar6y pick an iedividtml bear , then yea will see that it hibernates in winter ; of course , the bear y~l will select will probably rmt be the same bear I am thinking of , but it still hibernates in winter '' . Notice that this paraphrase ( as we aassme it is ) does not i [ ~oly the existence of a 'prototypieal ' bear to khich the general property of 'hibernating in winter ' < '~ihould apply : we are referring to an arbitrary element of the class we are talking about , although ~.~ are not saying that no exceptions exist . It is this non~identlfiability of the element for which the property is predicated that allows the he ; men to obtain the state general result . But now , what is the difference between ex.5 and ex.6 ? In the first ease ( specific interpretation ) , the speaker is referring to a particular individt~al , ~hereas in the second one he is not . We . can state that in the specific interpretation IDE~ [ 'IFIABLE ( S , S , x ) , whereas in the generic interpretation 'not ID [ ~I'IFIARLE ( S , S , x ) H , x ) ' , that is , to the speaker 's knowledge , x is not identifiable by the hearer by ire~mns of the expression EXP used . Note that this does not mean that the hearer will not be able to identify x , but only t~at the speaker is not willing to asssme so ( s~m examples will be provided afterwards ) . The representation we get for ex . Table I : Sem~tie representation of the r~_aning of determiners . Note that the representation includes the R~ , ' predicate , which will be actually built up on the basis of the expression following the determiner , . This has been done in order to provide a means of unifying the variable x occurring in the other predicates with the one appearing in the representation of the relmining NP . It could be argued that there is no reason why in the analysis of definite determiners we allowed the 'expression ' following the determiner to refer to an intensional object , whereas in the inde~ finite case we do not . However , lar~uage works just because we assume ( sometimes incorrectly ) that a given lexeme refers to the same concept for the whole comr~nity of language users . This means that ~e can not accept a reading where 'not ENABLNSAFEREF ( S , H , EXP ) ' occurs and where EXP is intended to refer to a generic concept . In order to discuss the other two interpretations of indefinite determiners , we need to refer to their use in eases different from the subject of the sentence , or , more precisely , in sententlal contexts where there is another partecipant , different f~em the speaker , who has an 'active ' role . In these cases , the representa ~ tion m~st account for the existence of a referentiality predicate attributed to someone different from the speaker and the hearer . The first well known example is provided by a 'desire ' verb , that is 'to want ' : 7 ) John wants to nmrry a Norwegian Some different meanings can be characterized by the hearer 's different replies : 7a ) No , Ingrid is n't a Norwegian . 7b ) Who is she ? 7c ) How does he think he can find one ? In the first case , the speaker is using the word 'Nor~ngian ' to refer to John 's future wife , bat the speaker does net agree on that word ( * ) . In the second case , the hearer assumes that the speaker is referring to a specific girl whom he does net knew . In the third case , he assumes the speaker is not referring to any par ticu ] ar Norwegian . In all cases there is a common core in the representation of the initial sentence ; it is : But now ~e have the possibility to characterize two subcases of c : in the first one ( ci ) S does not know the Norwegian that John wants to m~rry , but John does know her ; in the second ease ( c2 ) the identification is generic fer both of them : 7cir ) IDenTIFIABLE ( x , x , w ) 7e2r ) not IDENTIFIABLE ( x , x , w ) The last determiner ( in Croft 's analysis ) is `` any '' . Its represen ~ tation is reported in table I , but lack of space prevents us from discussing it ( mereover , not all students agree on its status of determiner ~ vs. quantifier ~ and no Italian lexeme has a meaning exactly equivalent to `` any '' ) . We list below the rules m~re strictly concerned with the operational inter1~retation of the predicates associated with deter ~ miners : A few words on the functions used in the acticn part of the rules : locatenode looks first for individual referents ; if none is available it considers generic nodes . createnede builds a new instance of the most specific available concept identified by exp . iooateset works exactly as looatenode , but the node that it looks for nust represent a set . Tnese rules are not complete , as they do not take into account ~istemic and Intensional Indefinite : in fact , both the represen ~ tations of these interpretations nust include the hypothetical knowledge of another individual and , as we said before , we did not treat belief contexts . Interpretation of de~terminers and quantifiers is usually oversimplified in many natural language interfaces . We think the for~ melism discussed in this paper constitutes a significant step in representing the meaning of the sentence at a more abstract level than many interfaces do ; at the same time we can directly exploit the features of this representation to build the actual update cor~nand or query . Other approaches use a direct translation of the sentence from its surface form ( or from a purely syntactic tree ) into a representation language which is actually a KB ~ement or a DB query language . The formalism discussed in this pages does not make any assumption on the language used for actually accessing the KB ( and for this reason the formalism does represent the meaning of a sentence in a natural or at least 'neutral ' way [ Hobbs 1985 , Schubert & Pelletier 1982 ) . On the other hand , the formalism is not too far from the way the domain kncwledge is ( or could be ) represented inside a KB or DB , so that it is easy to develop translation rules stating ~nat operations on the KB or DB should be done . The constraints on the available space prevented us ~ discussing the problem of using the context to disambiguate among the different meanings of a given determiner ( e.g . specific vs. unspecific `` a '' ) . Some efforts were made and the results are encouraging , though in irony cases it is only very high-level information ( e.g . ~utual knowledge and beliefs ) can provide the basis for selecting the right interpretation .

The primary purpose of this paper is to present a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of demonstrative expressions in English , based on a corpus of naturally occurring discourse from a variety of spoken and written genres . We propose a comprehensive set of constraints on demonstrative use and suggest how they can be incorporated into a computational processing model which integrates the local centering and global focusing aspects of discourse structure . Finally we show how our proposed algorithm for demonstratives can account for stressed pronouns as well . Existing computational work on demonstratives has been based on examples from only three genres : experimentallyelicited apartment descriptions ( Linde 1979 ) , technical dialogues ( Reichman-Adar 1984 ) , and scientific textbooks ( Sidner 1983 ) . Testing computational algorithms against multiple genres of natural discourse is important , especially given the universal scope of current frameworks ( cf . Grosz and Sidner 1986 ) . We have chosen to systematically examine texts from a broad range of genres , which vary in spoken versus written medium , number of participants , degree of pre-planning , and formality of situation . These genres include informal conversation , partiallyspontaneous televised discussion , newspaper articles , and planning and technical documents . Demonstratives have generally been considered to be one type of deictic expression . Most of the linguistic literature on deixis has concentrated on classifying deictic expressions according to various parameters such as the linguistic or extralinguistic status of the referent . For example , Buhler ( 1982 ) distinguishes between demonstratio ad oculos , anaphora , and deixis at phantasma , whose intended referents are respectively found in the extralinguistic context , the linguistic context , or in memory or imagination . Similarly , Fillmore ( 1975 ) distinguishes gestural , anaphorie and symbolic uses of deictic expressions ; and Lakoff ( 1974 ) distinguishes spatio-temporal , discourse , and emotional deixis . Such distinctions have been useful as a basis for descriptive classification of various uses of demonstrative expressions , but we do not feel that they are relevant for an explanatory account of demonstrative function and so shall not elaborate further on them here . For the same reason we also will not discuss attempts to show that discourse deixis and/or anaphora is derived â€¢ from or less prototypical than spatio4emporal deixis ( of. , Lyons 1977 ; Fillmore 1982 ) . Our account is more compatible with the * The work presented here was partially supported under Control Data Corporation Grant # 86M102 and a grant from the University of Minnesota Graduate School ( Jeanette Gundel , Larry Hutchinson and Michael Kac , Principal Investigators ) .

It is this view which most closely reflects the assumptions underlying computationaUy explicit models of focus-constrained discourse processing ( e.g. , Linde 1979 ; Reichman 1985 ; Grosz and Sidner 1986 ) . We turn now to a presentation of specific claims about demonstratives which have been made in the literature . Focus shift . a . That but not it may be used to refer to an item no longer in focus ( Linde 1979 ) . That marks the end of a discourse section ( Reichman 1984 ( Reichman , 1985 . This but not that signals focus movement , except when this occurs in the scope of a quantifier or when its head noun is not identical to the head noun of an existing immediate focus ( Sidner 1983 ) . b . That but not it may be used.to refer to a preceding statement taken as a statement ( Linde 1979 ) . c. Stressed that must change focus ( Isard 1975 ) . ContrasL a . That may be used to indicate conwast , even for items currently in focus ( Linde 1979 ) . When this and that are used together contrastively ( 'copresent ' use ) , this specifies the primary , continuing focus and that specifies a secondary , temporary focus ( Sidner 1983 ) . Proximity . a . This is used to denote objects relatively close to the speaker and that for objects relatively far from the speaker or relatively close to the hearer . ( Fillmore 1975 ; Halliday and Hasan 1976 ; Lakoff 1974 ) b . Both this and that may corefer with elements in the preceding linguistic context , but only th & may eorefer with elements in the following linguistic context . ( Fillmore 1975 ( Fillmore , 1982 HaUiday and Hasan 1976 ; Lakoff 1974 ) . c. Both this and that can be used to comment upon a speaker 's own prior remarks , with this often signalling greater speaker involvement or continued discussion . Only that may be used to comment upon the remarks of another speaker ( Halliday and Hasan 1976 ; Lakoff 1974 ; Sidner 1983 ) . d. The interval denoted by a determiner this used with a time expression includes the speech time . ( Fillmore 1975 ) . That tends to be associated with a past time referent and this with one in the present or future . ( Fillmore 1975 ; Halliday and Hasan 1976 ) . Special effects . a. Demonstratives often have subtle emotional effects such as solidarity , distancing , sympathy , anger , irony , etc . ( Lakoff 1974 , Fillmore 1982 Halliday mad Hasan 1976 ) . b. Unstressed determiner this has an indefinite specific use in colloquial narrative speech , ( Lakoff 1974 ) ; shared attention and experience ( Halliday and Hasan 1976 ) ; topicality ( Prince 1981a ) c. Unstressed determiner that phrases have a first-mention use for expected shared referents . ( Wald 1983 ) . The basic concepts which we take to be crUcial for any adequate description of demonstxatives are ones which are central to a theory of reference in general . These are concepts such as topic , focus and various types of givenness . Since these concepts concern the cognitive status of a referent , definitions have often been iough and iatuitive , bv . : dcatiy con'ect but ~tot sufflcieLitly precise for eonlput~ ; ikmal iulplcmctmttion . On the oilier hand , because of the conlpledty of these concepts , attempts to ihrnish ntore precise opcrallonal definitions , e.g . on the basis of surlhce line .

My neighbors have this dog that kept me awake . We will be primarily concerned hete with definite noun phrases , where the speaker expects the addressee to uniquely identify the mlin'cnt on tile basis of the description in question . Th , e rcfe , e~lts of such expressions have often been characterized as 'given ' . tlowevcr , as pointed out by Gundcl ( 1978a Gundcl ( , 1978b and l'rince ( 1981h ) , givcnness is not a mfitary concept . There arc diil'ereat senses of givenness each of which is relevant to the Rn 'm of reicc , 'ittg expr , -ssions , but in different ways . hletttiliabitity . In the weakest sense of givcnness , the slmaker expects the addressee to uniquely identify the referent , but the basis for th : identification is iiTelevant . Not only can it be linguistic or extralingttistic , based on entities in immediate or long term memory , but it need not he based on any previous shared experience ; : it all ( cf . lIawkins 1978 ) . The basis/'or the identification may be enc~led in lhe form itselt , as in ( 2 ) . ( 2 ) I could n't sleep last night . The neigltboes dog kept me awake . This type of givenness , which we rctisr to as identitiability , is both necessary and Slffficient tot the use of deliniie articles . Shared t'alailiarity . Most identifiable entities are identifiable because of some shared experience between speaker and aft . dressec ; again this may be linguistic or exlralinguistic , based on local colRext or hmg term menuLly associated with shared cultural or personal expt : rienct : . It is tiffs slattls which we claint is necessary for the use of demonstrative expressions ( with the exception of indcfinit , ~ this ) . Thus , ( 3 ) unlike ( 2 ) , is li : licitous only if the addressee has prior knowledge of the dog in question . ( 3 ) I could n't sleep last night . That dog next door kept me awake . ActilzatioJii . Entities which are fantiliar on the basis of presence in the imnlcdiate discourse context ( either linguistic or extralingnistic ) are not only shared but 'in awareness . ' This sense of pjvcmless , which wc reler to as 'activated , ' ( of . Chafe 1976 , Gundel 1978b i and Vrbovfi 1982 ) is necessary tor pronominal reference , including pronominal demonstratives . Thus , that ' in ( 4 ) could only r~ : li : r to the bmkiog of a dog if this [ lad lrg ; eu ac~ivaR ; d b ) r the hnnu-diatc discourse context : ( 4 ) 1 could n't sleep last night . That kept me awake . Activation is also a necessary condition for determiner this . Demonstcative this , both pronominal and definite determiner , has the additional condition that it not only be activated but speakeractivated , either linguistically or extralinguistically by virtue of its inclusion in the speakers context space , as in ( 5 ) : ( 5 ) A : Have you seen the neighbors new dog ? B : Yes , and that dog kept me awake all night . B ' : ? ? Yes , and this dog kept me awake all night . [ r~ focus . Finally , the most highly activated entities are not only in the speaker 's arid ltearer 's awareness but are the center of attention at ; t particular point in the discourse . We refer to this status as 'in focus . ' Entities in .focus 1 always include at least the topic of the sentence as well as any higher level discourse topics which may not be overtly represented in the sentence itself . Under certain conditions , they may also include other elements such as the reference of the linguistic focus . Thus a shift in focus always entails a shift in topic but not vice versa . The status 'in tootis ' is a necessary condition for unstressed pronomlnals and also for zero anaphora ( cf . Gundel 1978b ) . The rehtlionship between tile various ( definite ) referential statuses and the forms that colTelate with them is shown in ( 6 ) . These statuses are in a unidirectional implication rclation such that any status on lhe hierarchy implies all statuses higher on the hierurchy but not vice-.versa : 6GIVENNESS IIIERARCIIY : in focus -- > activated -- > slmred -- > identifiable it that , this fllat N the N this N 40 CRITIQUE OF CLAIMS IN TIlE LITERATURE . Focus Shift . Observations regarding the focus shift functiou of demonstratives follow naturally from the theory outlined above given two additional , but uncontroversial assumptions -- that pronominal it is necessarily unstressed and that the overwhelming majority of definite noun phrases are not only uniquely identifiahle , but shared . As noted above , the prinlary distinction between demonstrative pronouns and unstressed personal pronouns is that the referents of the latter must not only be activated , but in focus . A pronominal whose referent is not currently in focus is necessarily stressed ( cf . Hirschbcrg and Pierrehumbert 1986 ) . Since it is necessarily nnstressed , the only third person singular neuter pronominals available for focus shift are the demonstratives that and this . This accounts for the distribution of that versus it noted by Linde ( 1979 ) as well as the uses of that noted by Reichman . Use of that in referring to previous statements ( also noted by both these authors ) is just a special case of focus shift , since the focus of attention at the point `` after a statement is made is typically not the statement itself . However , our data does not support Sidner 's ( 1983 ) claim that this but not that is used for focus movement . Exatnplcs illustrating the focus shift function of pronominal this and that include the following : ( 7 ) K i : And .. So what he DID was ... came in , set up the free ... 2 : and then he nlade wassail , with rum in it ' ? 3 : And .. made it in coffee cans and heated it on the stove in the graduate lounge . A 4 : Oh , gee . K 5 : And this was the solstice tree . lu ( 7 ) , tile topic and hence the focus of attention in K5 is the tree , which is activated by its mention in K1 thus licensing tile lThere is some confusion in tile literature resulting from the fact that tile term 'focus ' has been used in two distinct and at least partly opposite ways ( cf Ilaji~.bv~ 1987 ) . We use 'in focus ' to refer to tile psychological notion of focus of attention ( tlaji~ovgs focUSAl ) and 'linguistic focus ' to lefer to tile point of linguistic prominence in tim sentence ( the comment ) . use of a pronominal . However , since it is not in focus in K2 , K3 , and A4 , the reference to it in K5 constitutes a focus shift and thus requires a slxessed demonstrative form . Note that since the tree was speaker activated , either this or that could be used . ( 8 ) N 1 : I like the poor dog who was buried six times in one day ! K 2 : Oh . That must , that must be a story that comes from the Second Minnesota history , 3 : because that did n't appear in the , in the ah diary , 4 : so it must have come from somewhere , In ( 8 ) , the topic and hence focus of K2 is the story . Since the story is activated but not in focus in N1 ( the focus of attention in N1 is stories that N likes ) , reference to the story in K2 constitutes a focus shift and thus requires a stressed demonstrative . Note that the story continues to be topic ( in focus ) in K3 and K4 and that in K3 , an unstressed pronominal it could have been used instead of that . ( 9 ) N 1 : `` Bob loves Mary '' , 2 : and someone else wrote `` Mary loves Jim '' 3 : and I wrote `` Jim loves Bob '' ! ( laughter ) 4 : It was three different handwritings , three different people . K 5 : Yeah , that 's good . ( 9 ) illustrates the use of that to refer to a previous statement or utterance . Since that refers to the topic of K5 , the story activated in N1-4 ( but not in focus ) , use of that constitutes a focus shift . The focus shift function of determiner that ( cf . Reichman 1984 ) can be explained as a consequence of Grice 's maxim of quantity , specifically do n't be more informative than necessary ( cf . Grice , 1975 ) . Since the overwhelming majority of definite noun phrases refer to entities that are shared , use of a demonstrative determiner as opposed to the less restrictive definite article in most instances carries little additional information . Thus a demonstrative determiner is generally used only when the signalling of shared familiarity has some additional communicative function . This is the case when there is a shift in focus , as in ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , since a focus shift always entails a shift in topic and topics are necessarily shared ( cf . Gundel 1985 ) . In the particular case of ( 10 ) , there is not enough information encoded in the noun phrase itself to allow the addressee to uniquely identify the referent . Thus a demonstrative ( as opposed to a definite article ) is required in order to link the referent up with entities shared as a result of immediate discourse context . In ( 1 lb ) on the other hand , the demonstrative functions simply to signal a focus shift and therefore a definite article would be equally appropriate . ( 10 ) a. John , this speech was a magnificent triumph for the President . He showed he could stay awake for twelve whole minutes . He showed that he could speak every word off of his teleprompter , even the long ones . But the speech does n't have any chance of putting the scandal behind him , because the scandal is not about mistakes , as he said , and it 's not about mismanagement , as the Tower Commission said . It is about a betrayal of principles , it 's about lying , and it 's about breaking the law . b . And those issues remain . [ McLaughlin 3/6/87 ] . ( 11 ) a . These incredibly small magnetic bubbles are the vanguard of a new generation of ultradense memory-storage systems . b . These systems are extremely rugged : c. they are resistant to radiation and are nonvolatile . Contrast . The contrastive function of demonstratives , like the focus shift function , is related to the fact that contrast is marked by stress and pronominal it can not carry stress . Moreover , contrast may be just a special case of focus shift , since a eontrastive noun phrase always brings into focus other entities with which it is being contrasted , as illustrated in ( 12 ) : ( 12 ) a . In both cycle steal mode and DPC , the attachmeni feature ... responds with a condition code . b . For commands that do not require interrupts ( that is , commands executed under DPC ) , the eonditi~m code provides current device status information . c. For commands that require executiou in cycle steal mode followed by an inten'upt request , this first condition code provides information concerning acceptance of the command by the attachment feature . d. Upon interrupt servicing by the processor , the at tachment feature provides a second condition code and an interrupt word . Thus , the referent of thisfirst condition code in ( 12c ) is already in focus since it is also the topic of ( 12b ) . However , , ,dnce the use of this noun phrase brings into tbcus contrasting condition codes ( cf . a second condition code in ( 12d ) ) it is not only contrastive , but constitutes an implicit focus shift as well Proximity . The speaker-activated condition on this predicts correctly that both this and that can comment upon a speaker 's own prior remark as in examples ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) respectively , but only that can be used to comment upon the remarks of another speaker , as illustrated by example ( 9 ) . The same condition also explains why this is used for extralinguistic objects relatively close to the speaker and that for those relatively further away as in ( 13 ) , and why the interval de ~ noted by determiner this includes speech time , while that tends to be associated with some time prior to speech time as in 14This is so because speaker-activated means not only linguistically activated but activated within the speaker 's context space . ( 13 ) N : This tastes like water . This tastes like THAT ! Waita minute -- the stuff that 's $ 1.99 for two quarts hastes a-the same as one that 's $ 2.07 for a fifth . ( 14 ) K : There he was that hairy hound from Buo dapest/Never leaving us alone./Never have I ever known/a ruder pest Special Effects . As seen in the diagram in ( 6 ) , each of the referential statuses is also correlated as a necessary condition for a different type of definite reference . Since the statuses are implicationally related , reference with a particular form will generally imply appropriateness of reference with all forms associated with a status higher on the hierarchy , but not vice-versa . Thus , pronominal that in ( 13 ) may be replaced with that wine and these systems in ( llb ) can be replaced with the systems . However , not all cases of the N are replaceable with that N , as illustrated in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ; and not all cases of that N are replaceable with that. , as illustrated in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . The maxim of quantity would dictate that speakers will use the strongest possible form , i.e . will signal the most information as is relevant regarding the givenness status of the entity in question . The same maxim predicts that speakers would not use a stronger form than necessary in a given situation , i.e . they will not signal more information than is appropriate . Violation in either direction will often result in a special effect or implicature , as in ( 15 ) , where the use of this as opposed to the equally appropriate the conveys an effect of solidarity : ( 15 ) Gov . D ( from videotapel : I 've got the energy to ran this marathon , the slrength to run this country , the experience to manage our government , and the values to lead our people . [ McLaughlin , 3/20/871 We already noted that use of a demonstrative determiner often has a special effect , such as signalling a topic shift , because virtually all definite NPs are also shared , and thus demonstrative determiners do not normally convey much more infommtion than would be conveyed by the definite article . Similarly , in cases where the referent is not activated , determiner that acts as an ove~ signal to the addressee to search long term memoxy for the referent , as in ( 16 ) : ( 16 ) A : Yet * can get those little magic fi~ger jnbbies ihat tell you when ~o water ~t .

For an example see 0 ) above . As noted above , pronominal and determiner this require that the referent be speaker-activated . Thus we would expect to find that used extensively in any nmltiple-participant discourse , such as casaal conversation .

E~g~'aling~dstie ~'efereneeo While tile linguistic or extralinguistk status of the referent is irrelevant for predicting the form of a 1err , ring expression , this status does differ across genres . For obvious reasons , extraiinguistic reference occurs primarily in face-to4ace interaction , ( 18 ) is an example showing the use of tha * ~ for shifthag tile focus onto an extralinguistic entity , fblk~wed by subsequent reference using it ' .

Renfinder thatÂ° Since determiner that does not require actiw~tlon of the referent , but only that it be shared , it can be used to rote , to entities that art : not present in the irrmmdiate discourse context , as in ( 19 ) . [ Adidas . K : [ Adidas , ok. As notcd above , that N is sometimes used as an explicit signal to the hearer to search memory for the referent . One would expect such signals to be most common in interactions between individuals with shm'ed personal experiences , so it is not smprising that they would occur fi'equently in castml conversations between family menlbers . Typically such phrases include a relative clause specifying additional information to aid in the search and are often embedded in a request for confirmation that the referent gas indeed been located .. Since the referent is shared but not activated , it frequently occurs in left-dislocated constructions which have tile lunction of introducing or reintroducing a topic into the discourse . ( eL Keenan and Schieffelin . 1976 ) 5.2 Televised Discussions . The televised discussion was a videotaped episode of The McLaughlin Group ( initial transcript obtained from the Federal News Service ) . This genre is similar to the casual conversations in being spoken and multi . pmticipant , but differs in degiee of fi ) rmality and spontaneity and m awareness of an audience . Four journalists participate in a sttucttned discussion about current affairs under tile control of a moderator As shown in Discourse topic this . The televised discussions are distinguished from the casual conversations by the frequent use of this to refer to non-speaker activated entities . Such uses contradict our claim that this '' must be speaker-activated . To account for such examples , we suggest that a distinction be made between inclusive and exclusive speaker space , in the case of local discourse segments , speaker space often excludes the addressee , but with higher-level discourse topics , which are often shm'ed , speaker space includes the addressee . In such cases , which are characteristic of highly sl'uctured interactions , this ' may be used for something which was not initially activated by the speaker . In ( 20 ) , reference is made to the explicit discourse topic of ' tlm segment , Gorbachev 's decision not to cancel the smnnfit : 1The categories Same Speaker and Other Speaker include only referents which are locally activated in the immediately preceding utterance . Thus , they ate rnutually exclusive with the category of discourse topic . Pg_ ! I~ The attachment leaturc sends this inbound tag to the Series/1 channel controls to indicate a poll capture for interrupt se~wicing or nonburst cycle steal servicing . It is not used to signal a burst transfer . The previous sections Woposed constraints on demonstratives and discussed their use in different genres . This section outlines components of a natural language system that would capture the relevant notions of shared familiarity , activation and form ; and explores possibilities for incorporating these into current dis~ . course-processing algorithms . 1 Shared familiarity . At minimum , a computational rrtodel of shared familiarity requires maintenance of a user discourse his- . tory in which a record is maintained of all entities referenced in conversations with a particular user . Thus , for any entity in its knowledge base , the natural language system knows whether/bat entity has been discussed before ( shared familiarity ) or not ( familiarity unknown ) . Only in the former case can a definite demonstrative expression be used . The recognition of discourse units ( e.g . speech acts of Allen 1983 ) and the aelations between them , e.g . conversational moves ( Reichman 1985 ) , rhetorical predicates ( McKeown 1985 , Mann and Thompson 1986 ) are also important in demonstrative resolution . These require a sophisticated user model which keeps a record of beliefs and intentions of discourse participants . While such a model could be incorporated into existing discourse structure frameworks ( e.g . Grosz and Sidner 1986 ) , no specific proposals to account for shared familiarity have yet been advanced ( but see Sparck Jones 1986 ) . Activation . An adequate model of activation must isolate that subset of shared entities which is activated at any given point in the discourse . This subset includes entities referenced in the immediately preceding sentence , entities present in the immediate spatio-temporal context of the discourse , and beliefs and intentions relevant to the cmTent discourse segment . Many currem discourse algorithms which function at the local level of discourse structure can be used to model activation due to the immediately preceding sentence . For example , Haji~ov~i ( 1987 ) points oat that elements in McKeown 's ( 1985 ) potential focus list can be equated with activated elements . Similarly , in the current centering paradigm ( Grosz , Joshi and Weinstein 1986 , Brennan , Friedman and Pollard 1987 ) elements in the set of forward looking centers can also be considered activated . At the global level , Sidner and Grosz ( 1986 ) describe a model of discourse structure which indicates currently activated beliefs and intentions at any â€¢ given point in a discourse . In Focus . Elements in focus are those which are most highly activated . 2 These always include at least the topic of the sentence , any high-level topics ( including those not overtly represented in the sentence ) , and under certain as yet poorly understood conditions , the referent of the linguistic focus . In the cut'- . rent centering paradigm , the topic of the sentence is equated to the backward looking center ( ef . Joshi and Weinstein 1981 ) . In this l Kryk ( 1987 ) presents an algorithur for demo~lstrative interpretation in Polish and English based on Sidner 's 1983 algorithms . Kryk 's algorithm , bowever , does not appear to be explicit enough to serve as a basis for implementation . Moreover , some of the algorithm 's predictions , for example that the demonstrative that is never used fbr non-copresent extralinguistic reference whereas non-copresent this is u , ' : ed only for exla'alinguistic reference , are inaccurate . 2Although our notion of activation is similar to Haji~ovlt ( 1987 ) , it differs in that she considers the linguistic f~us to be more highly activated tha~t the topic . We feel that our assumptions about tiegrces of activation me more compatible wifli the fact , noted also by llaji~ '' ovfi , that topic maintains iir~ activation longer than does the referents of the linguistic focus . paradigm nns~essed pronouns are viewed as preferring an existing bacl~wards-lookhlg center as antecedent . We have suggested that use of a demonstrative expression or stressed pronoun signals that the option to shift the backwards-looking center has been selected over the otherwise-preferred option of continuing an existing backwards-looking center . Brennan , Friedman and Pollard ( 1987 ) , in fact , mention in passing that stressed pronouns in oral discourse could be used to unambiguously signal one such type of cer~ter shift . ( cf . Sgall ( 1984 ) , who remarks that demonstratives c~Jn be used to unambiguously specify reference to the linguistic fi ~cus of the irmnediately preceding sentence . ) Genre differences . A final application of our constraints is in the atea of discourse genre variation . We have shown that both the form and function of demonstrative expressions varies between diffi ; rent spoken and written discourse genres . Our final suggestion is that these and other genre differences should be further explored , so that it will eventually be possible to design maximally-efficient discourse-processing algorithms which differentially e , xploit such genre distinctions . 7o 1The rows n-0 , n-I and n-2+ refer to the distance between the demonstrative expression and its antecedent .
